# Hi there, I'm Terrorhelmut! 👋

Welcome to my little corner of GitHub! I'm a **hobby programmer** who's passionate about coding and constantly experimenting with different projects. I love to dive into creative coding challenges, and I mainly develop plugins and tools related to **Minecraft** and other fun stuff. My journey into programming started with a simple curiosity, and now it has grown into something I genuinely enjoy doing in my free time.

## About Me 🚀

I'm not a professional developer, but I code for the fun of it! Here are a few things about me:

- 🎮 **Minecraft Enthusiast**: I enjoy crafting unique plugins and mods that enhance the Minecraft experience. Whether it's small tweaks or larger systems, I love the challenge of making something useful for the community.
- 🌍 **Tinkering with APIs**: I like connecting different services and exploring the potential of APIs. Whether it’s automating things or integrating platforms like **Pterodactyl**, I always find it exciting to see how technology fits together.
- 💡 **Lifelong Learner**: I’m always open to learning new things, be it programming languages, frameworks, or just fun tools to add to my toolbox. I experiment, fail, and keep improving with every project I take on.
- 🔧 **Crafting Cool Tools**: From small scripts to more complex solutions, I enjoy building tools that solve problems—sometimes practical, other times just for fun!

## What I’m Working On 🛠️

I mainly work on:

- **Minecraft Plugins**: Custom plugins that add new features and make gameplay more interesting.
- **Server Management Tools**: I love tinkering with server-side tools and automating tasks. Currently diving deeper into **Velocity** and **Pterodactyl** APIs.

## My Programming Toolbox 🧰

- **Languages**: Java, Python, a bit of JavaScript, and whatever else catches my interest!
- **Tools**: Maven, Git, IntelliJ IDEA, and of course, a lot of Minecraft modding tools.
- **APIs**: Velocity, Pterodactyl, and anything that allows me to automate and extend cool projects.

## Why I Code 💻

For me, programming is a way to unwind and challenge myself. I love the sense of accomplishment that comes with solving a problem or building something from scratch. Plus, it’s always fun to see what I can come up with, whether it’s just for personal enjoyment or something that others might find useful.
